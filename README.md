# Git?
Git is a version control system that works by tracking any changes that happens on the files.

# What is the benefit of using Git?
Git helps you to focus on codes rather to manually create different versions of codes everytime you do the change. When your codes break,
just revert it to previous version with Git. When your codes gone, just clone it from Github. And many more uses as you dive deeper into
Git and Github.
